# NYC Citibike data pipeline
## **Project introduction** 
This is the final project in the [DEZoomcamp 2024](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main) course. \
First of all, I would like to thank [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub) for creating this course and giving the opportunity to take it for free, it's really amazing! \
In this project, we explore the [NYC Citibike rides dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html), which contains information about bike rides taken in New York City using the Citibike bike-sharing system. This project is use the dataset covers the second half of 2023 to insights and analyze.
## **Problem statement**
Our goal is to analyze usage patterns of the Citibike system in NYC during the second half of 2023, and identify trends that could inform future transportation planning. Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions: 
- What are the most popular Citi Bike stations?
- What are the most popular routes by subscriber type? 
- On which days of the week are the most trips made?
